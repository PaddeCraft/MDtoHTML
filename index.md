# Welcome
Welcome to my Markdown to HTML converter.  
It includes CSS, Codehilite, and custom embeds.
## Code
Code is highlighted.  
You only need to indent it by four spaces.  
Code:

> import random  
> list = ["a", "b", "c"]
> 
> print(random.choice(list)) # Print the Choice

Is going to be:

    import random
    list = ["a", "b", "c"]
    
    print(random.choice(list)) # Print the Choice
